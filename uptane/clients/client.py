  """
  <Purpose>
    This class contains the necessary code to perform Uptane validation of
    images and metadata which is required by both Primary and Secondary clients.
    An implementation of Uptane should use code like this
    to perform full validation of images and metadata.

  <Fields>

    self.vin
      A unique identifier for the vehicle that contains the ECU.
      In this reference implementation, this conforms to
      uptane.formats.VIN_SCHEMA. There is no need to use the vehicle's VIN in
      particular; we simply need a unique identifier for the vehicle, known
      to the Director.

    self.ecu_serial
      A unique identifier for the ECU. In this reference implementation,
      this conforms to uptane.formats.ECU_SERIAL_SCHEMA.
      (In other implementations, the important point is that this should be
      unique.) The Director should be aware of this identifier.

    self.ecu_key:
      The signing key for the ECU. This key will be used to sign
      Vehicle Manifests(by Primary ECU) or ECU Manifests(by Secondary ECU)
      that will then be sent along to the Primary (and subsequently
      to the Director). The Director should be aware of the corresponding
      public key, so that it can validate these ECU Manifests.
      Conforms to tuf.formats.ANYKEY_SCHEMA.

    self.updater:
      A tuf.client.updater.Updater object used to retrieve metadata and
      target files from the Director and Image repositories.

    self.full_client_dir:
      The full path of the directory where all client data is stored for the
      ECU. This includes verified and unverified metadata and images and
      any temp files. Conforms to tuf.formats.PATH_SCHEMA.

    self.director_repo_name
      The name of the Director repository (e.g. 'director'), as listed in the
      map (or pinning) file (pinned.json). This value must appear in that file.
      Used to distinguish between the Image Repository and the Director
      Repository. Conforms to tuf.formats.REPOSITORY_NAME_SCHEMA.

    self.timeserver_public_key:
      The public key of the Timeserver, which will be used to validate signed
      time attestations from the Timeserver.
      Conforms to tuf.formats.ANYKEY_SCHEMA.

    # TODO: Rename these two variables, valid -> verified, along with the
    #       verification functions.  Do likewise in Secondary.
    self.all_valid_timeserver_attestations:
      A list of all attestations received from Timeservers that have been
      verified by update_time().
      Items are appended to the end.

    self.all_valid_timeserver_times:
      A list of all times extracted from all Timeserver attestations that have
      been verified by update_time().
      Items are appended to the end.

      pinned.json file).

      respects (e.g. crytographic hash and length) except for the "custom"
      metadata field, since the Director includes an additional piece of
